##Known issues
[x] When you select a picture to upload if you remove the picture and try to add a new one. The new picture will not show up in the preview window.
[x] Client Side Validation only works when validation is listed in the model. So it currently doesn't work with devise.
[] Post media is not validated client side
[] Firefox textboxes don't display correctly. Check bootstrap scaffolding file and comment out 'background-image:none' for input fields.
